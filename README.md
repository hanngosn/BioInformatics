Biological Computations CSCI5314/MCDB5314

As problems arising in molecular biology, genome analysis and the
algorithms are optimized to address those problems. Computational biology involves the development and application of data analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling, and computational simulation techniques for the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.
